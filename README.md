# IDEAS AND TODOS

General Ideas
---

- Use formant changes as augmentation (are datasets biased towards male voices?)

Discriminator Netwerk based on PEAQ. Use it as loss function (https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/train-a-neural-network-and-using-it-as-a-loss-function/156601/9)
---

- annotate data with attributes used for PEAQ?
- Use PESQ as additional label (is speech more important than music for us?)
